# FreeBSD Desktop
## Desktop Environments installer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A simple script that uses dialogs to facilitate the installation of desktop environments for those with no initial knowledge of FreeBSD.

- Using FreeBSD 13.1
- Written in Shell Script
- Simple
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Kde Plasma
- Gnome 42
- Xfce
- Mate
- Window Maker

For now, there are only these 5 Desktop Environments options, I hope to add others according to demand and time.
Soon I will also put a menu of starter applications that you want to come with the installation.

## Installation

FreeBSD Desktop requires only internet to run.

For production environments...

```sh
pkg update -y
pkg install git -y
chmod +x freebsd_desktop.sh
./freebsd_desktop.sh
```
